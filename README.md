## Inspiration
Introducing Sliding Puzzle 3D, our submission for Flutter Puzzle Hack 2022. As stated in the problem description, we were required to push our creativity in the domain of sliding puzzles. Our only tool to do that was Flutter. And believe me, that was enough. 

We hope you all will like our days of effort. We look forward to all your feedback. Have fun playing! 

## What it does
It's an elegant web game that will provide a different and enjoyable experience for all puzzle solvers.

## How we built it
We built it all using Flutter and its wonderful packages and supports. We deployed it on codemagic. 

## Challenges we ran into
We decided to take a different perspective on this, quite literally. We moved past the typical boring puzzles in 2D and shifted things into a slightly 3D environment. Our main challenge was 3D blocks. We spent days thinking of multiple ways we can deal with 3D blocks while maintaining the inherent nature of sliding puzzles and also the rendering time of 3D objects on the web. In the end, we decided to look towards pseudo-3D approaches and found our answer in that. Our entire game is a perfect example of pseudo-3D games.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are genuinely proud of the work we have done in such as short time. We are proud of our 3D approach and the overall design.

## What we learned
We learned many things. Most importantly, the intricacies while developing for the web. We learned about 3D design. We found out about isometric tiles and how important they are in the gaming industry.

## What's next for Sliding Puzzle 3D
Maybe something more mutare. We look forward to shifting it to completely 3D whenever Flutter's ready.
